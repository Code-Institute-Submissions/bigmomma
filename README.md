#### Code Institute - Stream 3 Project
### by Clive Noonan
## What my Appliaction does and the needs it fulfils

# This Appliaction is a eCommerce SurfStore website. the concept of this idea came from a few days surfing in inchadoni. The website is needed for e-commerce, advertising and providing all the necessary information about the beauty salon. It provides details about treatments and prices, news and special offers, contact and location. It also provides an online store for buying beauty products.

Clive Noonan , Full Stack Student In CODE INSTITUTE

I am currently a student at the Code Institute Studing Full Stack Diploma in Software Development.

This is the fifth of five projects which I must complete in order to be awarded the globally recognised Diploma

from Edinburgh Napier University. This Project utilises The Front End Trifecta .

This project is based on a custom extreme adventures holiday Business & An App & Geolocation

My Main Interest for this project was to work off my surfing experience in a few days surfing in inchydony Irland this summer, 

with extreme sports & how a custom holiday company that would or could provided the services needed to fulfill

the scope of this company would be truly amazing .

This project was based mainly on the front Django FullStack, it is a static website,

It is a fully responsive website, to fit all screen sizes

From a broad perspective it does not have a database.

This business website is entended to lure the user in to see whats it all about, it is based an alpine adventures company which caters for climbing , sking & - snowboarding packages, with a company app & api teasers ,

A small pricing & packing table is provided to try to induce our customer to look further & enquire more.

The theme of this website is geared towards the sports & travel niche, while sticking to best practises,the colors should protray afeeling - of movement & style,

The content is intented to be informative to the subjects in point.

The site is designed in such a way that its not very easy to get lost , when a user is on the guide page, he can not go to the app page , similer , when a user - is on the app page he can not go to the Guide page , but all pages can be accessed from the home page , reducing the amount of routes to the same origin , this - was indented to reduce fustration & confusion

UX
Scenario-1
User1 recieves a hyperlink link from a friend recommending a website ,User1 clicks the link & has a succesfull connection to the website.
User2 recieves a text message with a hyperlink from User1 , User2 clicks the link , after a few moments of surfing the website , User2 decides that they would like to contact the company , scrolling down the page User2 decides to speed up the process & look for the nav-bar, with a quick glance User2 finds the nav-bar & accesses the contact link which in turn sends him to the contact section of the website , User2 is interuppted & never fills out the form
User3 is in work , while chatting on the phone to a college, user3 is recommended a website for a canditate for weekend away for some badly needed R & R , User3 asks for the link , recieves the link thru an email , User3 succesfully connects to the website on his desktop after browsing the site User3 decides to contact the company by way of phone , looking up to the nav which is visible anywhere on the page, clicks the contact section finds the phone number & succesfully contacts the company, User3 then contacts User2 to ask him to email the company for more info ,
User2 connects to the website on the bus after recieving slack message from User3, User2 finds the contact section again with ease procides to fill out the form , on filling in the email, half way thru the bus hits a bumb & User2 miss,s the @ symbol , when pressing the send button user2 is propted to correct the mistake , User2 corrects his typo , presses the send button & is transpoted to formspree.io message explaining the process , an option to "Go back to the original site" is clearly stated aswell as confirmation of contact , User2 is pleased
User4 leaves his docters practise where he was attending ongoing treatment for dispraxia, User4 recives a message on viber fro User3 recomending a website for there up & coming week away , User4 clicks the hyperlink & connects to the website , after browsing for a few min User4 relises that this is not the type of holiday for him, but is very impressed by the website , while scanning the website on his custom build in monitor he see,s the guide button & clicks the button & is swiftly sent to the guide page , there he is promted with a choice to let the application access his wifi, User4 clicks yes, he can easly make out the functionalty of this app & spots a restaurant only a few minutes away that User1 had recommended, User4 decides he wants to exit the website & looks to the nav, he see,s that there is only 1 logical option , Home , User4 is sent back to the home page , where he again see,s the app link in the nav bar, Users4,s custom built vehicle stops outside his front door, curious, User4 continues to browse.......
User5 recieves a phone call while sailing in the pacific on his satellite phone , from User3 , the last ten minutes of there conversation was about there weekend away, & asks him to send him the link over a satilite connection, User5 recieves the link & connects on his satilite laptop , he go,s to the "Contact Us" page & hits the submit form by mistake but is met with an error message about the required fields , User5 fills in the form for the first time & submits , agian he is met with an error message about the required fields, for the third time he access the contact page & see,s that his details are still there , except the @ symbol he was promted about, he fills in the missing field ,submits the form with all inputs valid and verifys that a success message appears. Success User5 is very pleased about the fact even tho it took him 3 attempts , he never left the contact section, User5 see,s the app button in the footer & is curious he contiues to browse ......
User6 is picked up at 12:30 from creche , after arriving home , user6 picks up his dads phone which is on the counter top, he is very couriuos to screen , he clicks the logo many times , but notices it does move but , he doesnt , he then clicks the traintrack like structures in the corner, he sees the fast like window wiper swoosh in from the side , he then clicks a button before he even looked at the letters , he is brought to the guide page , he clicks all the buttons , except the home button, then he recognises the letters in one word "home" he is then brought to the telly part of the phone , he touches the arrow , he is sent moving down the page , he then see,s a button & presses it , he is brought to a funny looking page with nothing on it, after a larger number of presses he finally sees the letters home once again, presses & is sent home , he decides to keep scrolling , after loosing interest, he decides to look for those train tracks agian ,again he finds them with ease, he see,s the swoosh of the wiper again, & imeteidlty presses a button & is brought to the app page he scrolls all the way to the bottom ,he lands on windows and decides to press , he presses all the windows & the funny looking lollipop stick but nothing happens except flashy things in the phone , User7 arrives home with User6.
###HTML5 Validation Holding strong against even the toughest tests

2 Weeks Later
User1 arrive,s at the office , when turning on his computer he notices User4, User3, User2, arrive togther , 10 min late User7 arrives after dropping User6 to creche , User 1 approachs all the Users & begins discussing there week away, after a lengthy discussion , they all make a discion on a date , User4 says to User3 "Will you drop that company we were all sepaking about, an email, you know how I hate using mobile phones, you know the name Freestyler , 4:00 o CLOCK... all the Users meet at the coffe pod on there floor , each one knows what each is other is thinking , User1 looking out the window of Goolge HQ in Dublin Ireland says ," guys do ye realise that Freestyler site is wide open for massive development" , I have contacted ROCC Software & arranged a meeting , looks like we will be holding off on that week lads,
User7 pops up & says " has anyone heard from User5 ", they look & relaise, User1 Says OK Lads lets get to work on finding User5, he did mention a restaurant that appeared when using Freestyler pro , we will start there , to be continued......
FEATURES
##APP Along side the main website , there is another element geered towrads the growth & marketing , which comes in the form of a start up & coming app to accompany the customer on there travels , of course this app is top of the line , with the up to date features.

API
With a mini feature of an api in the form of an weather API, this is the give the user a quick view of the up and coming app , that is the scope of the marketing call for the app page.

GeoLocation
With one more element which comes in the form of a restaurant API , powered GoogleGeoLoaction, this will request the user location , if the user chooses to agree to the browser then they will have the abilty to see & read the distance from there currrent location to the restaurant which is displyed on the front end, or the users viewport , while this feature does not have a database, it requires the data form a small json format in our js script, keepin this in mind to be very slim with the data bacause of googles page speed ,

HTML FORM VALIDATION
This Project also makes use of HTML form validation

2 Contact forms , one on each page gives the user the abilty to contact the company thru the use of Formspree.io, this will provide the user with a " back to original site " option , so in turn keeping our user on our website

Deployment
On deploying this project , I explored various options such as host providers & Linux Servers, but this approach would of been overkill as it would be hugly beinefcal to give myself the abilty to deploy with just one command line & a open secure connection by the way of Google.

This led me to FireBase, FireBase is a service in which we can deploy static websites on a free tier with excellent documentation and configeration options, it a excellent choice & can also be upgraded with relevent ease, all of this operation is carried out in our google firebase Cloud-console & Installed FireBaseCli,

To Deploy this project you need to have the latest version of Node.js installed on your local machine/pc

After installing Node.js & Checking you have a version number, you will have to navigate to your project folder & run firebase init , this will initilise your project directory with a firebase.json file , this file holds the configeration for your deployment

After initilisation you have to create can account with google firebase, (If you have a gmail, you have a firebase),
once logged in to google you will have the abilty to access the firebaseCli & its commands

Once you are satifactory with your project that you will be deploying, you will have to go your google firebase console, go to the Hosting tab & create a project, google will give you a default folder of PUBLISH,

So now we have 3 projects/folders , one on Firebase & one on Your Local Machine & one on GitHub(Providing you versioned controlled your project), now we will have to make sure we are in the matching named folder on our pc , just like GitHub,

After we have confirmed we are in our project diretory with our firebase.json

Then it is just a matter of running the command

firebase deploy

Now we have a live static website.

VERSION CONTROL
The development project folder lives at this address github

The deployment project folder lives at this address github <------ THIS IS THE LIVE PROJECT FOLDER

My project can be viewed fully deployed on Firebase here.
There is list of firebase commands for development & developers , you can find them here

FireBase

The project uses https://firebase.google.com/
To Run this code Locally , you have 2 choices , you can go to github & download the code directly,
Or you can clone this repo with
git clone
Requirments - Node.js - Git
Hints , make sure to have a pre made folder when cloning this repo, this is because I already had a Publish repo which was the development folder/project, so I git versioned the public folder of the deployment folder/project
THE FUTURE
I hope to develop on this project in the future to include a dynamic pricing system.
Migration to a PWA.
Get 100% in LightHouse
Migration to nginx server.

I didn't base my work off other code, I used only what I had learnt in syllabuss1/LMS1 & syllabuss2/LMS2(cloud-9).
There was also a orignal folder, but this folder was destroyed in a OS crash on my pc , so when my pc was in getting repaired I used a second pc, which I then cloned the project folderfrom the spare pc, when I got my repared pc back I had no internet at the time , so I needed to work on my project locally, so I copied the contents of the cloned project folder from the spare pc on to a usb stick which I then copied on to my repaired pc , so that is how I ended up with 2 repos for the same project , aswell as the similaritys in the folder names of public & publish , if there is any confusion to this , Student Care Certainly conatct me to clarify.....
It took me quite a while to work out what happened ......
Final Commit
After speaking with my mentor Chris , he advised me content issues, optimisation issues , ux issues in the nav , font issues on mobile view , Removel of local storage , migrate media files
All issues have been resolved, except Total dimensional optimisation of all images, the reason for this is time.
This website has gone from Performance 20%, ProgressiveWeApp 29%, Accessibitily 59%, Best Practices 74%, SEO 81%, TO --->
Performance 43%, ProgressiveWeApp 31%, Accessibitily 76%, Best Practices 87%, SEO 100%, I am very pleaed with massive improvement
In order to increase the performance even more would be transfer all css file inline to all html & migrate all libereires such as Bootstarp
lighthouse
10/09/2018 This is Clive Noonan , Code Initstute , Project Number1, Signing Off......
The website has a customer registration/Login area. This is currently needed for purchasing products online and writing customer reviews. --The customer has a profile area where they can track the status of an order and view all past orders. -- It also contains all reviews made by the customer and the customer can edit or delete these reviews as they wish. Along with that the customer can also amend and update their username or email address.
The project also allows staff members to add, edit or delete news and special offer posts directly from the website once they are logged in.
-- All other admin can be done from the django admin panel.
Technologies used:
HTML - hypertext markup language
CSS - cascading style sheets
Javascript - client side scripting language
Python - Programming Language
Git Bash & GitHub -for version control and backup of code
Bootstrap - A framework for developing responsive, mobile first websites.
Django - python web framework
Libraries i needed to install

Plugin - Coverage - I needed this during my testing of code. It generates reports which show you how much of your code you have tested.
Stripe - needed for online payment transactions for purchasing products
EmailJs - needed for the contact format
Gmail - needed for emails
Tiny Png - Used to optimise all photos used in the project https://tinypng.com/

Problems encountered
I committed my env.py which held my private develpment envrionmet variables to GitHub. To solve the problem i deleted the env.py file from all my previous Git Commits and added the the env.py file to .gitignore for all future commits
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm env.py' HEAD
git push origin master --force
git for-each-ref --format='delete%(refname)'refs/original|git update-ref --stdin
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now
echo env.py >> .gitignore

I committed my SECRET KEY to GitHub. to solve this problem I generated a new SECRET_KEY using a SECRET KEY Generator I then added this new SECRET KEY to the env.py file -I deleted the old SECRET KEY from the settings.py file and added the following code to the settings.py file to point to the new SECRET KEY in the env.py file. SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

Iterating a dictionary and trying to remove using .pop() method. I tried to iterate through my cart and pop/remove any items that had a 0 quantity value. Everytime the for loop poped/removed a value i would get a runtime error dictionary changed size during iteration. When i read up on this i discovered that you can not change a dictionary size during iteration. I came across an article QUORA Article and used there tip to change the dictionary to a list and then iterate and pop. This worked perfectly.

    for id, quantity in list(cart.items()):
            
        if quantity == 0:
            cart.pop(id)
The edit_profile view. When manually testing the view I discovered that you could change the username and email address to the same username or email address of other users. I had to add extra python code to the view to check that other users did not have the same username or email address as what the user wanted to change to.

When testing my checkout views.py. I could not test with my STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE key. It would return an error. After researching the Stripe documentation i came across the test card numbers and tokens. The token I needed for the card number i was using was tok_visa

If you want to have the reset password functionality in your Django project, you need to use the django.contrib.auth module.

Basically you need to import the following views (functions):

1.- password_reset

2.- password_reset_done

3.- password_reset_confirm

4.- password_reset_complete

For you to use these views in the perfect cushion urls.py file, you need to do the following:

1.- Import the re_path module (This is for us to some regular expressions in order to map the the views from the auth module).

from django.urls import path, include, re_path 

2.- Import the above mentioned views as this:

from django.contrib.auth import views as authViews 

Basically I am renaming the views as authViews.

Now for the views (I will call them by numbers), you will have to do this in the urls.py file. All these after the sign out url.

1.password_reset:

re_path(r'^account/password_reset/$', authViews.password_reset, {'template_name' : 'accounts/reset_password.html' }, name='password_reset'), 

This url will provide the password_reset form, so an email field will appear on the form so the user can put the email address and once the user has submitted the email, he/she will receive a reset password email.

Basically I am mapping a url (In this case, account/password_reset) and also I am making sure the URL DISPATCHER maps the password_reset view from the django.contrib.auth.views (Module views.py file). Also I have created a custom template and saved it at accounts folder that is at the shop->templates folder...You need to make sure this url maps the template as explained in above code and finally you put a name for the url (In this case, password_reset). 

2.- password_reset_done:

re_path(r'^account/password_reset/done/$', authViews.password_reset_done, {'template_name': 'accounts/reset_password_done.html'}, name='password_reset_done'), 

This url will inform the user that an email address has been sent so the user can click on a link to reset the password.

As explained on point one, we map the URL account/password_reset/done/, also a the password_reset_done view is mapped and a custom template is mapped as well (accounts/reset_password_done.html) and finally you put a name for the url password_reset_done.

3.- password_reset_confirm:

This URL will provide a change password form to the user so a new password can be typed in. But please keep in mind that that this url will use a regular expression so a token can be mapped and generated for the user (You don't want to change another users' passwords by mistake and this is the reason why a token is generated for a specific user).

re_path(r'^account/reset/(?P<uidb64>[0-9A-Za-z_\-]+)/(?P<token>[0-9A-Za-z]{1,13}-[0-9A-Za-z]{1,20})/$', authViews.password_reset_confirm, {'template_name': 'accounts/reset_password_confirm.html'}, name='password_reset_confirm'), 

Same procedure or principle...A URL, a view and a custom template will be mapped.

4.- password_reset_complete:

re_path(r'^account/reset/done/$', authViews.password_reset_complete, {'template_name': 'accounts/reset_done.html'}, name='password_reset_complete'), 

This url will mapped a custom html template and a view to inform the user that the password has been changed or set so the user can sign in on the website again.

O.K. So far so good :-)

Now it is time to show you the content on the custom HTML templates (They have to be saved at shop->templates->accounts).
