#### Clive Noonan , Full Stack Student In CODE INSTITUTE

# Big Mommas Surf Store

## I am currently a student at the Code Institute Studying Full Stack Diploma in ## Software Development.

## This is the fifth of five projects which I must complete in order to be awarded the globally recognised Diploma from Edinburgh Napier University.

## This Project utilises Python Django Framework.
## What my Application does and the needs it fulfils

# This Application  is a eCommerce SurfStore website, the concept of this idea came from a few days surfing in inchydoney..

# The name for the store came from , my son & step sons , when did would see the big waves coming they would shout out "The big mommas are coming"

# The need for this eCommerce store comes from the increase in the surfing culture in Ireland, with steady growth, &
# if we get another summer like the one we just did , then there will be a big demand for surf boards & surf gear
.

# My Main Interest for this project was to work off my surfing experience in a few days surfing in inchydoney Ireland this summer, 


## UX
# This application is a fully responsive website, to fit all screen sizes

# This indent of this eCommerce app  is indented to make it as easy & pain free to purchase a surf board & accessories
# online with the stripe payment system

# The theme of this website is geared towards the surfing niche, while sticking to best practises,
# the colors should act as a backdrop & create a focus point for the products,

# It is also intended to capture the attention of surfers as the main customer

# The content is indented to be informative to the products.

# The site is designed in such a way that its not very easy to get lost , most of the interaction between the application & the
# Customer is carried out on the main page

# This eCommerce app also makes use of Django pagination , each page holds a maximum of 6 products, so as to not overwhelm the Customer

# With a fixed nav bar, that moves with the customer, it is easy to bail out of the app asap, this does not annoy the customer & completely
# deter the customer from returning to the shop,


## Features
### SPLASH PAGE/SHOPFRONT FEATURES
# When arriving at BigMommas Surf Store the customer is presented with the
# splash page shop front , here the customer can navigate there way around the
# shop with ease, With access to all the features such as the shop categories , the search bar , signin  & signout aswell as the products,
# thus keeping the user in the shop for as long as possible,


### Accounts
# Our Accounts/Signin/Signout links are located on our frontpage in the navabar, # the navbar is also fixed to our page , so when the customer is scrolling the
# page , he or she will have the ability to access the signout option,

### Search
# Our Search Bar is located to the right & nicely situated away from the other
# elements on the page , making it useful only when nessecerry, this feature
# gives the customer the ability to search for previous products or new ones

### Cart
# Our cart link situated next to our shop link ,
# making the cart very easly accessible to the customer on the font page , this link brings us to the cart & checkout page 

### Category
# Our Shop link is located top right , which makes it ideally situated & very
# easy to see & access, with a dropdown to select a catergorie, this gives the
# customer the ability to select different categories

### Products
# Our products are located on the shop front below all the functionality


### Single Product Page 
# When the user dicides to purchase a product & cicks on the product the  #customer is brought the single product page , here they still have the abilty  to bail out or access the rest of the website
# This will then bring them to the CART & CHECKOUT PAGE

## Features
# CART & CHECKOUT PAGE
# Our cart link is located next to our shop link , keeping these grouped
# together is effective in easy navigation, accessing this link brings us to the
# cart page, here we can see our old or new products that we have selected, the
# cart page is also the checkout page , this keeps the customer ingaged in the
# activity they are pursuing, they do not have to go to another checkout page 
# The customer also has the ability to go home thru the logo link which is
# instinctive 
# The Customer can also keep shopping thru the continue link
# The customer also has the ability to increase the number of products or decrease the number of products that are considering to purchase.

### Stripe Popup payment system
## When the user has decided to pay for there purcahse they are presented with a ## Stripe popup payment box where they fill in the fields related to there user ## account & complete a purchase with there card in seconds & have the abilty to choose 2 step verfication , from mobile phone.

### Orders page 
## After the user has finisehd there purcahse they are transported to there thank you page , where they are informed of there order number
## The orders tab for each user is located in there profile icon on the navbar this is also accessible anywhere on the page 
 
### Mail Gun 
## After the user has finisehd there purcahse & there thank you page has come thru , the user will be sent an email from the Mial gun email API, this email will arrive in the from a HTML Templte to there email address that signed up wit.

### Admin & richTextEditor
## In this eCommerce Application the back end admin has the abitly to create users, update & create products & catergories & Content with the use of Django richTextEditor



## THE FUTURE
##### I hope to develop on this project in the future to an even bigger online ecommerce Store with a frontend react & a backend rest api auth system
##### intergration with eCommecre platforms such as Ebay & Shopify
##### Get 100% in LightHouse
##### Migration to nginx server.

# This Full Stack Framework eCommecre application looks & responses very very well across all screen sizes 

# There is one problem with my application & it is a subscription I have been locked out of my mail gun because I mistakenly pushed an api key , after removing the api key from GitHub I proceeded to contact mailgun,There I followwed the support team I correcting all the details of my account , where I set up 2step verification using the Google Auth App  but now I am totally locked out of my account.
I tried to signup for another account but they only except 1 mobile number & 1 credit card number My Project is ready & setup for email intergration as soon as mailgun unlocks my account, I am presently in contact with Mailgun, 

 

## Deployment

- The stages to deploy this project were_
- first I needed to install dj-database-url, this is a package that allows us to connect to a database url
- Then I needed to install psycopg2 , this is a package that allows us to connect to a postgres heroku database
- next I needed to freeze my requirements to make sure all my packages are updated, heroku will build our app with these packages & all there packages
- next I have to make my imports into my settings.py file 
- next I had to replace my database values with this code 
- DATABASES = {'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')) }
- next I had to update my env.py file with my database tuple which is set with os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL')
- I also extracted my secret key from my setting.py file & stored them in my env.py file with the same syntax of os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY')
- Then I went back to my settings.py file & replaced back my secret key with this code os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "")
- I then made migrated my database to my heroku postgres database, then I needed to create a superuser
- might have to add in here about rebuilding database

## Deployment Part2 AWS
- In this section of the deployment process I had to create an account on aws with a unique name ,
- I had to receive an automated phone call from aws , once verification was complete , I had the ability to log in to my aws account
- next up was to create a bucket on aws with a unique name
- next I had to grant access to anyone so my applications static files could be accessed from anywhere,
- I carried out this task while still in the Set Properties section of the bucket creation, once created
- next up was to access my bucket & then to select Static website hosting,
- Permissions is next with a bucket policy , a bucket policy is what allows access to our bucket(contents of our bucket)
- I did this with a json configuration which is standard , I just needed to insert my own aws bucket details, which I already created
- next task was to create a group policy to allow users, I did with s3 & IAM aws webservices, I created a group.
- after this I had to create a policy but this time for the group  ,
- next was to configure my arn credentials into my group policy json formatted document in the Policy Document text box on aws,
- then I validated & created the group policy, so next I had to find the policy for the group that I just created & attach it to my group
- next ws to create a user with programmatic access with the group permissions we had earlier created

## Deployment Part3 AWS
- next task was to test our bucket with an image file , in order to do this I had to grant permissions in the process of uploading
- next task was to install django-storages & boto3 & add storage's to our installed apps  , this packages will give us the abilty to connect Django to s3  
- next up was to configure my aws config credentials , such as our bucket name our region name our accesss & our secret key,
- I also had to configure my custom domain & static files location in my setting.py file
- next task was to go back to our .env file & add our aws configuration details where they can be ignored by the our .gitignore file
- I was send aws keys from aws , these wee stored safely, these are highly sensitive keys , so I needed to configure these in our .en file
- The next step in this was to run the command collectstatic
- this was to collect the static files & our media files , but to do this I used the technuige of seperation of concerns,
- This technique allows us to seperate our media files & our satitc files
- In order to accomplish this I made a custom_storages.py file in our top level Directiory in our cloud9 IDE,
- so I had to import my S3BotoStorge into my custom_storages.py & create a class to declare a location of settings.py
- next was back agian to oui setings.py & I then configured the relevent location of static 
- I then had change my storage.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage to custom_storages.StaticStorage to match the class we just created in our
- custom_storages.py file , then I had to finally run the command of collectstaic agian to transfer our static directory on aws s3
- next was to create a second class to represent our media files, which are now being served from aws & then once agian I needed to run

## Deployment Part4 TravisCI
- Next task in this deployment was to setup & configure TravisCI continues integration , after authorising travis to access git hub account
- I then found my project & turned travis on , next is to click the not so obvious build failing tab/button, 
- this will give you the option of a drop down box where we can select markdown as the chosen configuration, then we need to copy & paste
- markdown that travis gives us and insert into my README.md file , this is so travis can connect to our project/application.
- Next up was to create a travis.yml file and code in the configuration to declare python as our language
- also configure our requirements details so travis knows what packages to rebuild in order test our app
- Git add ,Git commit, Git push were next up, 

## Deployment Part5 If Statement & blocking the env file 
- I first had to comment out my env file , so my application would run I then had
- to change my database because I will now be running my application from heroku,
- I achieved this within an if statement which also acts as a point of access for Travis in my settings.py file
- Git add ,Git commit, Git push were next up, 

## Deployment Part6 Heroku
- now that my app is ready for deployment on heroku I needed to configure my config vars,
- this involved transferring all my keys from my .env file with matching naming values from the project into the heroku interface cloud console,
- next I connected/synced my git repo with my heroku app again through the heroku interface cloud console
- I enabled automatic deployment from GitHub
- I then needed the package gunicorn , this package is required to connect to heroku server,
- I then added the package to my requirements.txt file, for heroku
- Then I created a Procfile , to establish with heroku what type of app is being served ,
- in my Procfile I configured the file with web: gunicorn bigmomma.wsgi:application,
- this is how heroku knows that this application is a Django application
- Git add ,Git commit, Git push were next up,
- Next I configured the collect static feature on heroku to 1, this will prevent heroku from upoading my static files
- Next I allowed my host in my setting.py file for heroku to open my application
- Git add ,Git commit, Git push were next up,
- Finally I deployed my application from git hub 

## My project can be viewed fully deployed on heroku [here](https://big-momma.herokuapp.com/shop/).

## My GitHub repo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/90t/bigmomma)


## To Run this code Locally , a number of choices , you can go to [github](https://github.com/90t/bigmomma)

## Or you can clone this repo with
- [git clone](https://github.com/90t/bigmomma)
- 
- Requirements - latest version of Python3 - Git - Django2 - IDE/PYCHARM/ installed on your pc,
- 
- You will need to make sure you have python3 added to your system variables path,
- 
- create a folder in your selected location, cd into your folder/project using your cli/commandline
- 
- next you will need to create a virtual environment, with the command virtualenv env
